[Applause] each person who entered our therapy clinic answered a stack of questions before beginning treatment and during my years as a therapist there there was one question i always reviewed before meeting with a new client it asks this what is your purpose in life defined as a central motivating life vein something you're trying to accomplish now to be fair this is a difficult question identifying a single purpose in life feels really hard it also feels consequential many people spend years searching for and developing their purposes and some never find it but typically we see responses like this to be an engaged parent to make meaningful change in my community to build a career i'm proud of to live for a long time just keeping it simple but then there was the answer of one young woman who i worked with before meeting with her as i always did i flipped to see how she described her purpose and she wrote this to avoid being noticed by other people this young woman a bright witty compassionate high schooler decided that her purpose in life was to make sure that other people did not know that she existed this is the power of social anxiety at its core social anxiety is about the fear of being rejected when we feel socially anxious we become hyper focused on how we are appearing to others we scan the room looking for signs of threat and disapproval signs we might have slipped up and are at risk for rejection and then we seek comfort and signs of approval smiles head nods laughs and so on and while social anxiety can be exhausting it exists for a reason social anxiety tries to protect us from rejection and it does that by tuning us into the nuances and norms and dynamics of a social group so we can match our behavior to fit in with them and ultimately avoid being rejected now this is a good thing because humans are social we exist in social groups we rely on each other whether or not we like that but also more simply because rejection is painful take a moment to think about your own rejection experiences however cringeworthy we all have them maybe you were ghosted after a first date been there maybe you were rejected from your dream job maybe you were ousted from a friend group projection's unpleasant and social anxiety tries to protect us from it but social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere with the life you want to live and this happens when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined with your view of yourself when you believe you will be rejected because you think you have some inherent flaw deficiency or failing of character you were ghosted after that first date and you believe it's because you are not lovable or attractive enough you were turned down from your dream job and you believe it's because you're not intelligent or competent enough you're outside from that friend group and you believe it's because you're not interesting or funny enough our fear of rejection is really a fear of being less than less than we want to be less than we think we should be or less than we believe society wants us to be and over time this belief system can develop into social anxiety disorder when a person has social anxiety disorder they become overly concerned about other people scrutinizing them evaluating them harshly and ultimately rejecting them so much so that they begin to construct their lives around avoiding rejection because if you can avoid being noticed by other people then those people have fewer data points on which to reject you now social anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental illnesses in the world many estimates put it second only to depression in the united states alone more than 12 percent of americans at some point in their lives will have diagnosable social anxiety disorder that's roughly 40 million people now worldwide the estimates are lower they're four percent which in and of itself is interesting but based on current population estimates four percent of the world's roughly 300 million people that will potentially have social anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime and despite how prevalent it is it's widely misunderstood widely misdiagnosed and often missed entirely this is because several myths about social anxiety pervade our culture the first myth is that people with social anxiety are happier alone a stereotype of someone with social anxiety is a recluse you'd rather be hiding away alone in their bedroom than out interacting with the world and this is simply not true in research conducted in my lab we find that people with social anxiety disorder desire strong healthy intimate relationships to the same degree as those without mental illness and they do socialize they're not robotic aliens and when they socialize they often enjoy doing so in fact when we ask people with social anxiety how happy they are they report feeling happier when they are with other people than when they're alone this is because not all social interactions are stressful maybe someone feels socially anxious with friends but not the romantic partner or they feel anxious with strangers and acquaintances but not people like their neighbors or co-workers so even though some interactions are stressful people with social anxiety are not devoid of the basic desire for human connection they just have trouble obtaining it in certain situations with certain people okay so maybe then social anxiety people social anxiety do socialize and when they do they enjoy it but it's with a small tight-knit group of people and really social anxiety is about avoiding the spotlight and this is the second myth social anxiety is not necessarily about a fear of public performance well this is true of some people other people with social anxiety find performing in front of others less anxiety provoking than smaller more intimate conversations like where they have to carry a conversation one-on-one many people with social anxiety excel in careers that are intertwined with social evaluation and social performance modeling acting sports in may of 2021 naomi osaka declined to participate in press conferences of the french open she courageously and preemptively shared that they exacerbated her social anxiety shortly thereafter she received a wave of public backlash and scrutiny she goes on to play her first match of course wins and then she withdraws from the french open many people were perplexed about how someone could have social anxiety and also be the number one ranked tennis player in the world lead a fashion campaign with nike good choice and on the cover of sports illustrated in a swimsuit in an interview the year prior in discussing her social anxiety osaka explained on the court is completely different i love playing at arthur ashe because it's the biggest stadium and you feel the rumble of the crowd you kind of feel like a gladiator because it's super big quote and there are so many people watching your match but off the court if i was ever thrown into a situation where i had to speak in front of 100 people i feel like i would start shaking there is no one-size-fits-all profile of social anxiety just like people who are depressed have different collections of symptoms at different times for different reasons social anxiety looks different in different people and last and maybe the most problematic myth that social anxiety is fleeting and harmless social anxiety is not just something you grow out of it doesn't magically disappear when you graduate middle school or high school without intervention many people struggle with social anxiety for years for decades and social anxiety can influence every aspect of a person's life it can influence the hobbies they choose maybe opting for solo activities like reading writing rather than things like team sports it can influence the careers people pursue maybe opting for careers with more individual like computer time versus things like sales or customer service and social anxiety can influence people's everyday lives ricky williams star nfl running back heisman winning running back dazzled millions of people on the football field every week and yet he shared that he struggled with social anxiety and because of it he had difficulty interacting with teammates running everyday errands where he'd have to interact with people and even interacting with his own daughter the real tragedy of social anxiety is that it robs individuals of their greatest resource other people other people help us overcome adversity like recovering from illness or after you bomb a job interview other people help us celebrate milestones like showing up to the birth of our child or a wedding or a graduation and other people help us overcome loss like grieving the death of a loved one our fear of rejection gets in the way of obtaining and appreciating the benefits of being accepted the benefits of other people and in our modern world it is harder than ever to manage social anxiety we are more connected today than any time in human history and yet we are lonelier more depressed and more socially anxious than ever we have endless tools to socialize and yet we are seeing a decay in social connection in a rapid amount of time our social structures have been upended and rewritten technology and social media have created new standards for social relationships and interactions do i post it do i share it do i like it do i love it we create these bizarre extensions of ourselves through curated profiles and now avatars we try to make sense of unlimited feedback from a massive and often invisible audience and the cost of social blunders are higher things you do and things you say can live online forever and subject you to unforgiving scrutiny reputation loss and even job loss it is a tough time to have social anxiety but the world will become more not less connected and the influence of technology and social media will grow not shrink now is the time to address social anxiety and here's how the first and maybe easiest thing we can do is identify early early detection is critical because of those who go on to develop social anxiety disorder more than half will have developed it before their 14th birthday more than half and social anxiety puts people at risk for developing other mental illnesses later on of adults who are diagnosed with both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression social anxiety came first 70 of the time of adults who were diagnosed with both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder social anxiety came first it was developed first approximately 80 percent of the time what these data suggest is that social anxiety starts early and it puts people at risk for developing other mental illnesses but here's the incredible part social anxiety can be reliably and accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions questions like does your fear of rejection is one among one of your worst fears and is your fear of rejection get in the way of doing things that you otherwise want to be or enjoy doing the cost of asking these questions is like 30 seconds and zero dollars we don't have to create new infrastructures we don't have to up end existing ones we can embed early detection programs into our existing structures like at schools new year orientation one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings because if a doctor can screen for depression then she can also screen for social anxiety early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter the trajectories of young people the second thing we can do is harness our platforms one of the benefits of living in this hyper-connected world is that a single person can have a ton of power they can use their platforms to create meaningful and lasting social change i mentioned ricky williams and osaka who have used their platforms to share about their social anxiety and just from these two people we've seen the ripple effect in response to osaka's announcement viola davis oscar emmy tony award-winning actress shared that she struggles with social anxiety a woman whose job it is as an actress to embody and express the complexities of people in very vulnerable and very public ways but frankly these celebrities are not the poster children for social anxiety they are just three of the millions who suffer who are brave enough to talk about it and we can do the same with our platforms however big or small in our schools in our workplaces in our communities and in our homes because regular candid and forthcoming conversations about mental illness ultimately reduce stigma correct harmful myths and get people the help that they need the last thing that we can do is foster social courage addressing social anxiety is not about preventing or avoiding rejection addressing social anxiety is about fostering social courage being socially courageous means pursuing experiences and knowing that your chances of rejection are not zero in fact the chances that you get rejected at some point in your life at some point this year are high and worse you might be rejected as a function of who you are things about yourself that you cannot change where you come from what you look like or who you love being socially courageous means pursuing experiences because they are important to you and knowing that the successes of those pursuits are not contingent on your worth as a human being being socially courageous means knowing your worth and finding people and social groups that love and accept that person and being socially courageous means asking that person out applying for that job speaking up at that meeting or that party or giving that big talk on that big stage knowing that rejection lurks around the corner but the opportunity for growth and for purpose shines brighter a purpose not defined by ensuring that you go unnoticed in this world but a purpose that makes you feel most alive most present and most authentically you thank you
