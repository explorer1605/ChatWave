There was a gentleman by the name Chundraan Sut. So he used to come to our office. >> Yes. One minute. The Chandra Khan Sut. >> Yes. >> He was part of Wow. >> Hello and welcome to the latest episode of this show. My guest today Rajiv Tucker, CIO Parak Parik Mutual Fund. Rajiv, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for doing this for for our audience. >> Thanks a lot. Aj you're you know an outlier in many ways. We'll come to that later. I want to start with your early career. I believe that you're also what I call the batch of Hershad Meta. >> That's correct. >> When he was at his peak followed by the fall, then the liberalization era. Can you just recount this you know for our audience how that was an influence that it pushed me in the markets for sure and I've met a couple of other fund managers who also recall that time when all they could think of was um going towards capital markets what was that like for you >> so there is this concept of spirit of the times right so today a young person would typically be drawn to a startup where you create a company out of nowhere a bunch of 10 bright young people get together uh have a brilliant business idea, raise some money, go for a listing and become billionaires. That's the spirit today. Late '90s it would be to join a IT services company uh go to the US and work there. The spirit of the times in 1992 when I graduated was one uh India had gone through a very tough time. Uh we had to pledge our gold uh gulf war and rising oil prices and things like that and then we were in this liberalization phase. Indian industrial licensing was abolished and uh business was being encouraged. There was this famous bull market that you referred to Harshed Meta. Most people uh remember this by the TV series you and I have lived through uh that period. >> So a young person at that time especially someone in the commerce field would be naturally drawn to the capital markets. So that's uh how although by qualification I'm a chartered accountant after 92 uh I pursued 3 years of education but uh I was drawn to capital markets from 92 itself. >> Yeah. A lot of people say that's that being a CA you already know annual reports that would have come naturally to you but in the '9s you know the thing is that when when the hash meta era peaked you also had a loss decade for equities 93 to 2003 >> yes >> when the markets went nowhere and fixed income was giving you very stable guaranteed returns >> how did you live through that entire uh period before you came into the stock market what was that like what did you do and you know I'm trying to get at the early foundational principles for you at that point of time. >> So 1992 to94 uh I had to do the >> audit article ship. I had to go to factories do stock taking uh do expense voucher audit uh trial balance balance sheet audits and things like that. 94 uh so after 2 years one is allowed to escape to the industry. So 94 I escaped to investment banking. That was a time where that was a period something similar to what we are seeing today >> where you would have multiple IPOs launching on the same day in a week some 10 companies would get listed. Uh so I was doing IPO related work. So I was the backroom guy vetting all the prospectuses and uh doing stuff like that. So in short 1994 to 2003 I was jack of all trades. >> Ah okay. uh 94 I was doing as I said IPO related work but within a year and a half that work had dried up. So we would go to office no company was going public sit in front of the computer screen and the when the boss was not looking play computer games because >> obviously >> there was nothing else to do. So then people said this person has nothing to do. So I was put in corporate finance which was uh effectively raising bank loans for the company that I was working for. >> Okay. >> So did that for a couple of years >> by that time. So this was around uh 1995 uh kind of era >> mid '90s. >> Mid '90s. Yeah. Mid '90s. 95 to97 interest rates were peeking out. Yes. You mentioned interest rates. Government bonds were yielding 14% peranom correct semiannual. Uh Tatast steel lnt AAA names at that time were raising money at 18% peranom. >> Okay. >> And uh Reliance Capital at that time AAA NBFC raised money at 21% peranom. So bonds were a no-brainer at that time. So since I had no work to do on the equity side I and then I did corporate finance then I got shunted to bonds. So 1997 to 2003 I was doing interbank government bond brokerage. >> Okay. >> And 2003 was when I actually shifted to equities. >> What were your early days at Parak Parik like? And once you answer that we'll get into the man himself. >> Sure. So uh I joined PPFS Parakar in uh October September October of 2001. >> This was this was immediately after 9/11. So my joining date was end September 2001 after 911 had already happened. >> So capital market environment was down and out. But I had joined the organization on the bond side as a bond brokerage. >> What was the organization like then? because I want our audience to know they know it today as the mutual fund house which has some pretty good schemes managed by you. What was it like in 2001 when you joined? >> It had multiple activities and those multiple activities were uh subscale. We were not off the charts in any of the activity. So we had a retail brokerage division uh but which was limited to uh one or two locations in Mumbai, South Mumbai. We had not caught on to the nationwide branch network that other people had ventured into. We had the institutional brokerage desk uh in equities. We were servicing >> uh FBI or FIS as they were then called Indian institutions uh insurance companies, mutual funds. But what had happened ironically was that since we were early into equity research and we had a good talent pool, >> we were the raiding ground for anyone who came into India. So we lost a lot of talent to well capitalized foreign players and that was struggling because of uh lack of buying power for talent. >> I know that a lot of CIOS today go back to that era. I mean the kind of pedigree that you had then that Paraki had then was really something else. >> Yes. So institutional brokerage was a challenge. We were institutional brokers in bonds as well. So that's where I joined uh government bonds as well as corporate bonds. That's what we were doing at that time. We were early into the advisory space. Of course that time there were no direct plans. Everything was distributor plans. So we had a ARN number and we were mutual fund distributors and advising on third party products. >> Sure. >> And we had a tiny PMS within uh the organization. So these were the multiple activities that we were doing. >> I joined on uh as I said late uh September 2001 and I was interviewed by Mr. Nimisha who was the CIO of the company then and Paragai I met after the interview was over he said I'm just meeting you to chat you are already on board but I just want to get to know you as a person. So that that was the first time >> I interacted with him. >> What was he like? >> So uh I had read about him before I met him. So he used to write articles in the media on a subject which I had never heard about at that point of time that was called behavioral finance. >> Oh in 2001. >> Yes. >> So uh at the time of dotcom boom uh he did not find any fundamental value in a lot of companies that were shooting up. >> Yeah. >> And uh he would say you should not buy it and the stock could double triple. He was extremely frustrated. He said let me just take a break. Uh and he went to Harvard to study this subject behavioral finance. And he was immediately after doing that course he was already writing for the mainstream media. So uh I had read a lot of his articles before I even got a chance to meet with him. >> I mean he was that big picture long-term thinker with you know goes back to Mer and Buffet. Am I right in that? So uh there there were various interesting people in the organization at that time. >> Please tell us. >> So uh Paraguay as I mentioned was the big picture behavioral finance control your emotions uh opportunities will come off come your way and there will be no-brainers. There was a gentleman by the name Chandra Khan Sat. So he used to come to our office. >> Yes. One minute the Chandra Khan Sut. >> Yes. >> He was part of >> Wow. So he was a mentor to Parag. So Parag's father and Mr. Sat were very close friends. >> I had no idea about that. Please go on. >> And he used to come to our office uh and uh spend a few hours uh in our office mentoring young analysts >> such as yourself. Uh yes I was slightly later to the game but uh so of course I spent time with him but there were people who had a privilege of interacting with him for five seven years 10 years kind of >> so Paragai Chandraan by who else? >> Uh there was a young colleague of mine Njaranda who unfortunately passed away few years back so he was there were other uh people uh Melvin Mata then we got to know Mr. Chetan Perik uh he used to come. So E Sundaram I got to meet because he would once in a while drop by. >> What was that experience like? I mean you're getting I mean we are sitting here in 2025 which is fine. At that point of time these people were different. Yes. >> Now we know who they were who they are for those who are around. What was that experience like for you? If you were to look back and think of the founding principles that were probably laid in your head. What was that like? So firstly uh if both these gentlemen were alive today Chandra Khan Sat and Charlie Mer they would be almost of a similar age. Uh and a lot of ideas that we read through uh Burkshshire letters and through Burkshshire AGMs were developed by first principles almost by Mr. Chandra Ganut. So this uh importance on management, importance of balance sheet quality, low leverage, high return on capital, all this came intrinsically to him >> and uh this concept of even uh discretionary spending or uh the owner earning concept. >> So famously he Mr. Sat was a investor in FMCG companies and he would not look at EPS or P&L. He would look at how much they are spending in discretionary advertising which he would term as a uh if investment in plant and machinery effectively because that is >> the goodwill that they are creating and >> I saw that you will say dividend but I didn't expect to hear you know on the plant and machinery. Okay. >> So he would uh so there would be maintenance advertising and there would be brand building advertising to launch a new product to enter a new geography. So he would break all that down and really uh have his own understanding of what real cash flow and real earnings is. >> Lovely. When did you make the transition from debt to equity at Parakar? >> So interestingly this happened over a over snacks and drinks in the evening. I'm a tea totler but Parag would take out take us out to CCI maybe two or three times a week uh just to unwind figure out what's happening uh brainstorm ideas so one of the evenings uh we were talking about uh our own mutual fund distribution business our very very nent portfolio management services equity >> uh and uh in passing someone mentioned why to one bother with equity these days because bonds have given uh 20% return peranom in the past >> and the way 20% returns came by was I mentioned 14 and 18 >> uh interest rates what happens is when interest rates fall not only do you get the interest income coupon >> but the bonds also appreciate in value so there's a capital gain element in that so people who had debt State mutual funds were seeing past returns of as high as 20% peranom and equity was flat for a decade and especially in PMS apart from the index you also reduce expenses. So >> the trailing returns were looking very very pathetic. So I said this is not going to last and like it was uh almost as if someone said something inappropriate and coming from a bond guy saying this is not going to last. He said please explain why would you say that? I said what was 14% peranom in 1995 by 2003 that is around 5 and a half or whatever was the yield at that time 10 year government bond yield >> at that time expense ratios on mutual funds debt mutual funds were very high >> I said out of five and a half six whatever is there if you remove 2% then intrinsically it's going to give you 4%. M >> this is assuming interest rates flatten and then they don't rise >> because yeah from here chances of them falling very significantly are low because we are already close to inflation and uh I don't see too much of a fall bulk of the fall is here I said makes sense and I said at this point in time at that time hero group and Honda JV was still there so it was called hero Honda >> Hero Honda The stock price was 180 rupees. Previous year's dividend was 18 rupees. So 10% dividend yield >> and expected dividend was higher. Eventually it came out to be 20 rupees. >> Wow. >> So when you were buying it at 180, you were buying come dividend of 20 rupee dividend in a few months time >> in the largest motorcycle brand in India. >> Yes. And it was a growing company and at that point in time uh tax laws were such that dividends were tax free >> taxree >> long-term capital gains were taxree. I said in such an era why would you not focus on equity because if bond funds are going to give you 4% assuming no rise in interest rates >> and here you have 10% plus >> on equity >> uh dividend yield and capital appreciation. It's a no-brainer. He said, "Yes, makes sense." By that time, the long bare market has had has its effect. Our PMS was started in 1997 >> when the early licenses were given >> early licenses were given. But by 2003 after 6 years, our assets under management were sub 4 crores, 3.85 crores, >> uh to be precise. >> Wow. I was I was waiting for a number of 50 or 60 because even that time >> okay >> so it was sub four crores we were having difficulty uh even from the revenue we would get to pay the audit fees to do the fund accounting and all that so there was actually someone had proposed why don't we shut this down >> uh so and people had left because money was not coming in and there there was nobody to take charge so by asked me and nurture my colleague would you guys want to take it he said sounds exciting so that's how I shifted from >> my god >> bonds to equities in the 20 years after that have you ever seen a time when interest in equities was as low as that I'm saying 2008 lio 16 lio 30 I'm just I want to give our audience a flavor of what it means when and I know this because I was there and you know When people say equities are dead, it's invest that that that that that disbelief is a mouthwatering opportunity for anybody who knows how stock markets work. Have you ever seen a phase like that happen afterwards? Maybe in the tech boom, I don't know. So very briefly got glimpses of that in 2008 where people said world is ending not because uh everyone is going bankrupt and all that and not to that extent but uh again world is ending kind of thing in covid where you said uh think I was on a TV uh panel uh and all of these were happening on zoom those days because lockdowns were there. Yeah. So, one of my co-panelists in the CNBC interview uh mentioned some 15 books on the Great Depression and the Spanish flu and how large sections of the population were wiped out. And so these two occasions uh were somewhat similar. Not valuations didn't go to 2003 levels, but still there was panic. >> Yeah. I mean aside from the numbers it's always about the mood and the sentiment. It's what people are talking about like you said the spirit of the times. >> These are once in a lifetime opportunity to anybody I would I would assume. >> Okay. Um so let's move forward from there. Your PMS management career what was that like? How long did that last? What did you do after that at Paratpai? >> Sure. So uh 2003 was uh as I said we said equities are looking much better than bonds. So at that time what we said is how do we get clients excited to come to equities. Uh today this fee structure would look very very greedy but at that time we said uh clients would get excited by this. So at that time uh portfolio management fees were 2% peranom charged half a percent every quarter. >> We said let's go to clients and say we will operate a PMS on a zero fee structure for you till the time you make 6% peranom compounded and with uh catchup and all that. So uh because 6% peranom was the >> bond yield >> bond yield and all that. We said there's no way we see that bonds will do better than equities. So if we do less than bonds don't pay us a single rupee all the operating expenses audit uh all the staff salaries we'll pay out of our pocket >> risk-free rate. Okay. >> So that's how we went to clients. So some people said we will continue to pay 2%. We said we are happy to. So both options were there. It was not compulsory and we said above 6% we'll share 25% of the profits. This was also the original Buffett partnership formula the original fee structure. We said we went to market with that >> and at least people said if they are thumping the chest so much and uh saying this we will allocate to equity. We said allocate to equity buy either equity mutual funds through our uh wealth the distribution platform or give money to PMS either way works but please don't keep money lying around in bonds. So that's where the shift started happening pretty soon. So markets >> took off, >> went on a tear, took off. But very soon there was this bump down the road within a year more or less >> 2004 election outcome. >> Ah correct. Yeah. The first one. Yeah. >> Lower circuit. >> Uh yeah, lower circuit in the market because uh a minority government supported by communists. >> Yeah. Uh >> who would have thought? >> Who would have thought? So the Communist Party leaders were interviewed on national television >> and they made some spectacular statement. I remember that. Yeah. >> They said how do we care market is on lower circuit meaning stock market is anyway useless. >> I think that that got aired on a business channel like >> business channel. Yes. >> So two lower circuits again. So whoever had missed out the first part of rally 2003 to 2004 >> again we went and said you missed it you are getting a chance again >> come and buy people said okay so even things like HDFC bank and all we cleaned out the quantity on the lower circuit so those kind of things were available on the lower circuit that was a good time uh almost three three and a years of smooth sailing, good fun. 2007 was when the challenge really started. >> Correct. But you couldn't have called it in 2007. 2007 was euphoria or I mean no >> 2007 was very very challenging for me personally. >> Okay. >> Uh so what happened was the I mentioned Mr. Chundraan Sat. I mentioned our roots Paraguay all that >> we were investors in companies like Marico, Asian Paints, Pidlight, uh Nestle value and asset light businesses, high ROC businesses, >> cash, >> uh management quality, all of that. >> 2007 was when the set of companies which started going up were not in tune with what we were doing. >> The same quality. >> Yeah. So real estate, infrastructure and commodity these three sectors were rising remaining were not rising. So the heroes of the market at that time were DF, Unitech, Lanco, GMR, GVK, >> Cesarago all all those companies were running away and we were not participating. I was a young guy at that time uh 3 four years into equity management and uh people who were client-f facing people in our company if people bought mutual funds they were okay people who >> PMS >> uh had put money in our PMS those people were making decent positive returns with us but on a relative basis we were not market the gap was not that much. Okay. >> The market was making 3x what we were making >> in 2007. >> That was the Okay. Wow. >> So that was 2007. We had a internal meeting very heated uh heated meaning not that Paraguay was pressurizing me but our uh sales guys had taken or RMs not sales we never actually sold stuff to clients. So our RMS were getting push back from the end customer and they were in turn venting that in the internal meeting saying what are these guys doing why can't they uh smell the coffee and see how the world is changing so much infrastructure is going to get developed >> take a uh drive in Gura and figure out how much the land bank is why are these people not understanding how the world is moving uh so I said I'm doing what I opening beyond this framework that I've read about or I've inter interacted with some knowledgeable people I don't understand some of these companies so >> after the meeting I went to Paraguaya and said meaning >> uh you have an organization to run >> uh if you think someone else is better equipped I'm happy to step down uh it's not necessary so he just smiled he said uh this is what I actually wanted to hear from uh you >> okay >> he said I have gone through the same situation I have gone through.com uh whatever >> 12 years ago yeah when he was sitting >> 7 8 years ago yeah >> 99 whatever huh 7 8 years ago yeah >> he said fundamental basis whatever I said >> was proven >> was proven wrong in the short run but eventually it makes sense If you had said something different then I would have been worried. I think this is just what I want you to do. >> Uh don't get shaken by what these jokers are saying. >> So that's uh when uh I felt good and uh continued doing uh what we were doing. There were some redemptions. So uh >> clients went away uh mid 2007 end 2007. Those people came back 2008 2009 with diminished portfolio values. That was the unfortunate part. But yeah 2008 9 were actually good for us. We were enjoying that time. >> What was the Rajiv Tucker like 20 years ago when he was going through all this. I want you know our audience to kind of get that psychological feeling that Paragai already went through that and I know because you know >> the late 1990s and early 2000s when it was very comfortable to write that Infosys trading at 200 times is an attractive buy okay what was that you know fast forward to dealing with sectors which make no sense redemptions pressure from RM how was how did you go through that >> so at that time uh relatively it was easier because no one knew me when they were it was between me and 100 clients or five RMS or whatever. So these days uh so it it was like uh playing cricket with no audience and versus playing a match with a stadium full of people and live telecast and >> one dot ball and people say >> idiot why can't you hit for hit a six and especially when you are not even playing a playing a 2020 you're playing a test match how does it matter if it's a dot ball >> I'm just very you know I'm it just speaks a it speaks very highly of Paragay that sticking through those times. See, because we are in 2007, everybody's making money, you know, fist over whatever, you know, over the top, if you're an asset manager, if you're a PMS or if you're a mutual fund, you have to go with the crowd, right? I mean, that's the time to make money. And you're seeing this after 2003 when, like we said, equities was dead. Is this speaks very highly of his um character to stick to his guns, be you know, be have your conviction. You think that that's what was happening then? >> Absolutely. So like difficult to find people like him. So some of the incidents that I hear about happened before I joined uh PPFS >> but we unit trust of India as it was then called not the UTI mutual fund of the predecessor >> was a big client for us. lot of our revenue would come from that company and around the time of the uh crisis that uh happened and where the sale and repurchase price was much higher than the NAV. Our recommendation to clients was you should redeem unit 64. >> And >> this was before the scam. >> Yeah. before it came out and but it was publicly known that NAV is much lower. >> Uh but people thought rep sale repurchase would continue as it is. >> So Parag went and told clients saying if the market price is much higher than the NAV there's no reason for you to hold on and same thing in the case of Morgan Stanley growth fund for example >> the famous Morgan Stanley growth fund. Yeah. So he said NAV is the true value of the if the uh NAV is much lower than sale repurchase price you should take your money out and the organization got very upset saying and despite the risk of business going away said I'll say what what is the correct thing and what the clients need to hear. That was one uh instance. The other thing was business was booming but the risk was increasing because at this was at the time of the uh physical share certificates >> uh volumes were increasing at such a pace that the operations were not able to keep up. So bad deliveries would pile up and receivables would pile up. >> This audience doesn't know bad delivery by the way. >> Yes. This audience does not know. So uh it was uh something like the uh accelerator is being pressed >> and engine is overheating which will blow up but you don't want to lose the race. You keep your foot on the accelerator. >> Sure. >> He said he just >> shut his business for 3 months saying for 3 months I'll only tackle bad deliveries. I'll not transact voluntarily with any of my customers. So he had this knack of doing what is required for long-term survival and things like that. >> Where do you think that came from? Because I'm kind of when you you know when I hear something like this I just feel that there are two factors at play out here. reputation and trust. And those are the two things that matter the most in life in general in whatever purchase or transaction you're doing with anybody more so in financial markets because if you don't, you know, reputation comes from trust and trust is built you know it's like a same thing and it just seems that he had that thing very early on and the character the integrity just it just says a lot. Do you think that's one of the factors? >> Yeah. So let me give the downside to that also or a flip side. Uh so uh most things which are positive have a small downside. Let me portray both these sides. >> He had what one would call the worry gene. >> Okay. >> So conservatism uh not to take extra risk which led to survival. So like they say in the uh forest people who worried when the there was a rustle in the leaves and who ran away are the people who are our ancestors because they survived. >> Someone who was brave and said no no no it's just wind probably got eaten by the tiger. >> So he had this worry gene. He would worry about what things what are the things that can go wrong >> that helped us survive over 45 years and grow. It also led to missing out on some trends. >> So the thing that I mentioned, he focused on bad deliveries and shut the business. That was the very same reason the focus on survival conservative approach to business was the same reason he did not expand nationwide. >> Okay. >> Now when DMAT came in and when computerized transaction came in probably that was being overconervative. Yeah. >> So it led to missing out on one trend >> then uh acting in client interest >> and not encouraging glam gambling tendencies. We never had a FNO desk. >> No derivatives. >> No der though which led to severe market share loss in brokerage and we eventually exited retail brokerage. Yeah. >> So it had both aspects but uh largely it's helped us in terms of uh >> staying true to who we are. >> Yeah. Folks if you're wondering why we are spending so much of time just on Paragai, you should know that these are good behaviors that are that last through cycles. It's not just about him. The man represented certain values that will definitely hold any long-term investor through various kinds of market cycles like Rajiv was saying that they come at a cost but I think over the longer term one is still better off if you stick to your principles. Okay. um post GFC what happened after that what was you know I'm I'm just trying to set the stage for 2013 when the mutual fund actually started these last four years post GFC what was that like >> sure so uh in the midst of GFC we had this idea that we should transition from a PMS structure to a mutual fund structure >> okay >> and that we came at this decision through maybe five six seven angles and Each thing was uh saying mutual fund is a compelling structure. One should not continue in the PMS structure. PMS client onboarding was becoming increasingly ownorous. So uh to onboard a PMS customer we needed a PMS agreement, DMAT account opening, >> BC account, NSE account, stock brokerage account, custody agreement and for NS there would be more paperwork PIS uh and all that. >> Maybe throw in a power of attorney there. >> Yeah, power of attorney as well. >> So uh local resident would need around 75 signatures uh V signatures and at that time there was no digital onboarding. NRIs would require around 100 signatures and it would happen sequentially. First open the bank account then register the PA power of attorney. After the bank account is opened then the DMAT account would be opened then the custody account would be opened. Onboarding would take more than a month. >> This was one part. At that time the entry level for a PMS was 5 lakh of rupees. >> Correct. Yeah. >> Which went to 25 lakhs which went to 50 lakhs. This was visible. The media discussions, regulatory discussions had started. We said increasingly we'll serve only the ultra wealthy. We'll not have the existing client profile. >> From that time we were interested in global diversification, global stocks which was not permitted in PMS. >> Correct. >> Even today it's not permitted in local PMS. One has to set up a gift PMS to do global investing. So global investing was not permitted in PMS. Tax laws would change was there in the first direct tax code which was introduced in the parliament. Uh yeah the so from various uh aspects so mutual fund was a simple paper one single form on boarding. >> Yeah >> for various reasons we said mutual fund is where we want to go. >> Okay. The thought process started in 20089 but it took almost four five years for us to actually operationalize that. >> Yeah. >> Let's jump into this here. I mean I'm trying to understand you launched in 2013. I just had a look at your fact sheet of that time. Of course I think the fund was called long-term equity. >> Long-term value fund. Yes, that was your first name. 22% in foreign stocks and that also diverse like Nestle 3M 2013 if I remember correctly was what taper tantrum yeah roughly there's some Europe crisis going on US something or the other was happening at that point of time >> I don't think these talk stocks were even cheap I mean Nestle I think globally I don't know so I'm just trying to arrive at the fundamental logic of investing in foreign stocks in 2013 These were reasonably cheap at that time and they were far cheaper than uh the Indian stocks equivalent to Indian stocks and at that time uh companies like Nestle were giving 5 to 6% dividend yield. >> Okay. and 3% this is dollar uh Swiss Frank kind of dividend yield >> and if you add 3% >> currency >> currency depreciation we were getting around 8 9% kind of predictable cash flow returns >> without even capital depreciation >> without capital appreciation and plus we have said going global is about two or three things not necessarily about capturing maximum returns. One is it gives you lower country specific risk. No matter how good our country is, there are some factors which will affect only India. So this pelgam attack operation synindur is a India specific event. Global stock markets get affected but not to that extent. Uh demonetization or a GST introduction are country specific events both positive and negative. So on the positive side, a surprise tax cut that was announced, corporate tax cut. >> Indian markets went up, global markets did not. But when you have part of the money abroad, it evens out the volatility. The ups and downs are not that severe. So that is one reason to go global. >> Second is while Indian market is well diversified, >> still there are certain gaps in industry segments which we don't have here. So uh electric vehicles uh a company like Tesla or a BYD these are outside our Indian source uh Google, Microsoft, uh Facebook, Amazon, Netflix >> not available >> not available in India the uh innovator companies of GLP1 noises and lily and all are not Indian companies. So there are segments which are not available in India. So if you want to invest in them, you have to go abroad. TSMC or >> ASML, Nvidia. So all of these are foreign companies. >> Where do you build research capabilities? I mean it's not like you know you're a foreign you know like a city or a so whatever it is who has branches in the entire planet where so 2013 is also a time when you know your mutual fund was not as large as it was today. >> Yes. >> Foreign brokerages I don't know you know would have taken you seriously or not. How did you build that capability to >> Well, you said foreign brokerages, Indian brokerages were not taking us seriously. So, we had a midsized Indian brokerage who we said we are a new mutual fund and we would like to work with you. They condensed to say business. The RM for us >> was from their HNI desk, >> not even inst not an institutional broker. >> So yeah, so uh we were not getting foreign sellside uh research. >> Mhm. But we had over the years with uh a lot of people who were working in various sectors and again uh one within India we don't want to cover each and every company. We filter out uh promoters managers who are not according to us uh people who we want to partner with. We filter out sectors which across a cycle have not generated a decent return on capital. >> Okay. >> We filter out very very highly leveraged companies. >> Utilities and banks are exceptions but otherwise we don't want uh too much leverage. >> Okay. >> So within India our coverage is somewhat limited and those same analysts would cover their global counterparts. Ah >> okay that made sense. Yeah. >> Yeah. So increasingly uh what we say is your country of listing may not matter so much because if you are today buying Tata Motors in India, you cannot not have a view on Jaguar Land Rover. >> If you are buying Bharti, you need a view on their African operations. >> Very interesting. >> If you are buying Hindalco, you need to have a view on Noveism. And even if you are just buying the Indian company, let us say if you are a analyst covering VRO, Infosys TCS, all the analysts will log on to a cognizant and accenture conference call >> and most likely we'll have a view on those companies. >> We said let's structure our research on sectoral lines rather than geographical lines >> and let's go where the opportunities lead us. >> Very interesting because you're talking 2013. All these acquisitions were in 27 uh 2007 Bharti and uh whichever I think it was >> Tata Steel Cororus, Tata Motors, >> all of them happened at I got the foreign story you know diversification it makes a lot of sense about how a lot of Indian stocks are also going global and like you said how you get access to sectors that are not available in India but then you have push back from a lot of people fund managers included key India's growth story is the best on the planet you have rupee then you have to be in India fastest growing economy in in the world how do you reconcile with that one of the things I would urge people is firstly don't look at country of listing as the country of operations so if you want to buy a or participate in the online travel agency business in India the company is not listed here the company is listed overseasm uh two large auto companies in India have parents overseas and their overseas subsidiary overseas parent companies are at such low valuations. If you ascribe the Indian valuation to that piece rest of the global business comes very very cheap or almost for free >> in uh some cases. >> Yeah. >> So that is one. Second, the GDP growth of India may not translate uniformly across sectors. So if you are in let's say oil and gas exploration or a global commodity like uh steel or zinc or copper >> even crude maybe. >> Yeah. So those cycles are global production depends on your oil well not on what is India's GDP. So the opportunity may come abroad. Then the other factor is to keep in mind is GDP growth may not translate into profitability. So Benjamin Graham said this decades ago. He said obvious prospects for physical growth >> do not translate into obvious profits for investors. >> Yeah. Now there are real life examples from India itself. Mid90s if you were to look at the sunrise sectors of that era. Private sector airlines and telecom would be two sectors one would think would make a lot of money. Indian airlines was the monopoly operator for domestic civil aviation. Private airlines came in. Not a single company from that era is alive today. Indigo came in much later. >> All of them went bankrupt. uh telecom companies from that era probably only Bhartiel is around uh Vodafone idea is around in some form but hasn't made money historically >> everybody else was e either consolidated bankrupt whatever yeah surrendered the license >> uh volume road does not translate into profitability >> what matters is pricing power balance sheet competitive intensity uh management integrity and competence various various things have to come together for you to benefit. Now if I say this sector is going to double in next 5 years, it may seem like attractive place to be in. But if I say currently three players are operating in this sector, three more will enter with very ferocious intent and uh >> balance sheets maybe. >> Yeah. with uh strong money power then it may not look that attractive. So one has to balance it out. Our northern neighbor China >> has had phenomenal growth over last 30 years. >> Their uh equity markets has given a dollar return peranom which is sub 2%. >> Wow. >> Over 30 years. >> Over 30 years. >> Yes. >> Okay. So uh it's not automatic that uh and they have brilliant companies out of there. So they have the 10 cent by do Alibaba BYD cattle all all sorts of companies are there uh Huawei but people have not made uh too much return out of that market. So one has to be stock specific ultimately because uh you can't rely on GDP tailwind to make money on your portfolio. >> Okay. early years of fund management right 2013 to I don't know 2018 maybe you just uh pre-lockdown what was that like for you because if I remember correctly 2006 to 16 might not have been the last decade like 93 to 03 but 2006 to 16 was empty returns even though we had a new you know we had a change of ground in 2014 when the markets went up what was that like because your fund outperformed every year each and every year I think when you started except maybe for maybe one or two years in the What was the early experience like? Because I think the kind of stocks that you invested in domestically were also very different from where we from where you are today. Let's talk about that. >> Yes. So we said we will go where opportunity takes us. We will go across small cap, midcap, large cap. We will go across sectors. We'll go across geographies. India plus overseas. We will not bother too much about what is there in the index. >> Okay. on first principle basis on fundamental basis and opportunity should make sense for us. So there were companies that did well for us there were companies that did not do well for us. So there used to be a tollbridge operator which due to legal reasons had a change in business model. There were two or three stocks which did not do well. But overall in that environment where there was tremendous amount of uncertainty in the marketplace uh uh broken balance sheets of banks, broken balance sheets of corporates, >> uh lackluster growth. We stuck to things that were looking reasonably good. And the year where that you refer to 2017 where we did not do well was when uh again there was a rampant uh up move in small caps. >> Yes. Yes. >> Uh so we were not participating in that uh in 2017. >> So by end 2017 January 2018 we were in a lot of cash. We were as high as 30%. And then 2018 there was this big >> crash in the small caps. So that uh helped us uh navigate that uh year. So >> uh broadly we were fine uh in that sense. >> You also had a very big event in terms of Parak Parik passing away. What was that entire event like? So more than uh the business side it was a personal uh shock uh we were in the car I was driving the car there was an accident he passed away so uh how well so one is uh Mrs. Gita Pararik was injured. So uh her recovery and health was uh something we were focusing on at that time and uh lot of things happening on the personal side. Apart from that the worry was that end of the day mutual funds are open-end products. Client can say >> give us our money back. So our thing was would clients want redemptions or would there be redemptions? So we were prepared for that. uh some colleagues had to uh this happened on the weekend had to sit through the night to figure out uh in case there are large redemptions how will we uh honor them and how will we generate liquidity >> just for our audience the year was >> this was 2015 >> 15 >> this was May 2015 so we were prepared uh from that Right. But to our greatest surprise, uh there were no redemptions. >> Wow. >> Uh obviously the small redemptions which anyway keep happening those would happen. Someone would have needed money but because of the accident because of Parag's passing away he had so much goodwill and people had trust that the organization would uh carry forward his uh values and uh his vision. Um so at that time I was in the US uh Neil also had to come over for uh the funeral and all that. Once we came back to India we started meeting people. People had two things to say condolences uh let us know any way we can help and they said we are very happy with the organization. Some of them actually had checks ready. So instead of redemption slips, we are adding more money meaning we are not worried at all. >> So this 2015 right >> 2015 >> the mutual fund business is what 2 years old? >> Yes. >> You had a PMS or you had wounded that down or what was that like? >> So all the PMS uh clients were migrated to the mutual fund >> mutual fund business. >> Yes. >> So and there was broking at that time or there was no broking? >> Broking had almost shut al or we had shut the operations we had surrendered the memberships. I you know the reason why I'm asking this is because if it was any other mutual fund that had just started from zero in 2013 and in two years would have such an event I don't know what would have happened I'm just thinking that whether this was the cumulative trust built over the previous what 20 30 years >> yes >> that kind of really you think that was one factor >> yes so most of the early clients in the mutual fund were the PMS customers so although in the mutual fund structure they were there only for 2 years >> these These are the people who we met in 2003 saying it's a great time to invest in equities. >> Who we said okay 2007 we are not chasing the market who saw our behavior in 2008 and 9. >> Those are the people who stuck with us and added uh money. >> Where does this investor behavior come from? See you know this thing called the investor gap. >> Yes. which is the fund return versus the investor return and that is ascribed to investors doing random things buying selling up down this that hey here I have an example of people who just stuck with you >> yes so I think it's a self- selection in a way um like birds of a feather flock together or whatever >> a person who wants to do expiry day options trading is not going to come to us >> a person who uh wants to build wealth over decades will find this as a likely home and will automatically get drawn towards uh a fund or organization like us. >> Okay. Again folks investor behavior this is you can't get anything better than this. See also Rajiv one thing is there that 2013 to 2015 16 17 whatever it is AUM were also I think what you would have reached about 500 600 crores by >> uh yeah 2015 we were at 650 odd crores >> uh May 2015 you would be around 600 650 crores >> yeah so cash I want to talk about that because our discussion so far there's it's just been anti-conensus okay 1999 2000 Paragi said don't buy IT stocks faced the heat paid the cost proven right 2007 hot sectors face the heat proved himself right and you know 2013 goes and invests in international stocks when everybody is India focused again same thing cash let's talk about that what is behind this because almost every fund manager that I've met is very clear that we don't take cash calls PMS though I don't think can even do cash calls given the structure of at least whatever it is or it's possible it's possible take it >> walk us through this I don't know cash obsession or whatever you want to call it >> so someone this this is not my phrasing this is someone else's phrasing I uh don't remember the name of the person but otherwise I would have attributed the quote to him he said that cash or money in the bank account is a unspecified call option on an unspecified asset at a unspecified strike price at a unspecified time. So uh you don't know which stock is going to fall. You don't know when it is going to fall. You don't know at till what price it is going to fall. But you can exercise that only if you have money in the bank account. M >> if you are deployed to the last rupee that opportunity is irrelevant to you m so this is a long form statement >> a short very successent statement was given by Mr. Chandra Khan Sat >> he would keep money in bank FDs which can be broken at will and you get overdraft against bank FD if you so choose and he was in the higher tax bracket. I in my nave thing saying you can invest in taxfree bonds or other things which are sellable. M he had just one question can you write a check said what said on a tax-free bond or on a debt mutual fund can you write a check I said no you have to redeem it and then you can write a check said that doesn't help me >> when the opportunity comes I want to be able to write a check I don't want to wait for anything else to happen >> if I can write a check I can avail of that opportunity >> it's worked for you so Yes, >> it's not like previously when you said about lost opportunities that had happened in the business. That's not been the case so far with cash this kind of a call. >> So last one year headline indexes are zero to marginally negative maybe 1% 1 and a half% negative >> cash money in the bank has given 7% 7 and a half% whatever. Uh what are some points in your I mean we've already spoken about this but I want you to kind of summarize looking back at your career at those toughest moments in your investment decisions that really tried and tested your character. Let's talk about that for a while. What was that like? So a lot of people ask about 2007 2008 that was actually easy meaning >> as you said >> which was like uh the good thing about the organization is that you have backing of at least one of your bosses. So I say every fund manager has three bosses. One boss is the organization CEO or the promoter whatever you call. The second boss is the uh distributor, advisor, media, whoever influences the purchase, sale decision of the end customer >> and the third boss is the end customer. >> Any three of them can fire you at will saying you are no longer required. Now in this organization you have your boss having your back saying I am with you. uh the customer may redeem or may give you more money but as long as you are following the agreed upon process we are standing with you. So that is easy. So 2007 was not that difficult. >> Yeah. >> Uh the toughest period for me was uh 2020. >> Not from a financial perspective. it was this uh unknown fear around the disease itself. So financially I knew that uh if the world is going to survive and if humanity is not wiped off it's a great investment opportunity. And the fear was in family you have elders >> uh we had some close relative who had undergone a transplant and who was >> hit with covid. know whether that person would survive the covid uh infection or not. Uh the sheer fact of being locked up in your homes not able to go out in sunlight. So uh 24 by7 news cycles that uh personally was challenging more than the financial markets as such. So that was one period and of course without question 2015 the passing away of >> Paraguay. Yeah, I want to talk about now the post pandemic boom that happened in your fund which has pushed it to aums of you know I don't know whether you had 10 years ago you could have thought that you would be at that >> absolutely not >> what do you think happened >> the optimistic scenario was nowhere close to where we are right now >> two questions one is what do you think really worked and second is do you think you know where does this go from here for you >> what worked for us is what's working for every D2C brand in the country. >> Okay, this would not neither would PPFS have happened or neither would D2C brands have happened uh two decades back or three decades back. So the uh rails were not there for the uh train to go through. If we were a mutual fund in '90s, we would have had to open branches all over the country. We would have had to employ an army of people filling out paper forms, doing inerson KYC, >> uh collecting checks, all of that. >> What changed is internet happened. Uh Jandhan, mobile, trinity, common, >> KYC, internet banking, all of that. So what happened was a customer who over the years has been onboarded by SBI mutual fund, ICM mutual fund, HDFC mutual fund, the large pioneers in the field. They have onboarded the customer in the mutual fund ecosystem. They have done the KYC. That KYC >> resides with the KYC registration authority. >> We just have to ping saying is this PAN number valid? >> Valid. If this PAN number is valid uh we can onboard the customer. >> Yeah. >> So this is one second the clear distribution ecosystem that has been built the ARN holders. So now there are three tracks. One is the ARN track which is the historical track where mutual fund distributors uh help onboard customers give incidental advice all of that. Then there are all these platforms. So to an extent we have also benefited from platforms like Zerodha coin uh Kuera Grow all of the platforms >> ET money PTM money all of the platforms which enabled DIY investors to on board. >> Sure. >> And the internet uh websites and the mobile apps that we have. So someone can go to the app store, play store, download our app and get onboarded. >> So this was not possible two decades back. So I think it's a thing of getting discovered and then ease of getting on boarded >> largely. >> What happens from here? There's no literally there's no other mutual fund of your scheme. Sorry there's no scheme of your size. Uh so that will one that is by design at the industry level >> because people want to launch diverse strategies with diverse set of managers. >> Uh it's also e in terms of pure economics it makes sense to have more schemes rather than concentrate in one scheme. M >> so to that extent we get seen as a large one whereas the active equity aum of the larger fund houses is maybe five six seven times >> what you are >> what we are so partly it's because we run limited number of schemes >> okay >> limited strategies >> the other thing is plenty of people are coming in so today we have 47 fundous >> seven fundouses are already in pipeline so we'll reach 54 55 very very soon and you are having uh large players small players all sort of so players coming in so there are >> uh the uh leaders in the brokerage ecosystem who are here >> zero the AMC is there Angel one >> all these players are coming in black rockck is coming in uh you have people like uh capital mind alchemy uh alchemy backers and various people are coming in. Uh >> so it will be exciting. Lot of product launches will be there. Lot of competition will be there. I don't think it'll be a one-way ride. There will be ups and downs. >> You're kind of welcoming competition saying that that that's going to be a good thing for us. >> Any growing sector will attract newer players. Okay. And >> unlike banking where licensing is very strict, >> Yeah. SB has been reasonably welcoming a has been reasonably welcoming of newer players. >> So I would expect people to >> I just remembered one thing on the point of cash is that given the kind of proportion that you have you know the high holding of cash at it's obvious that timing plays a big role like you said that you know something will happen you you don't know when and how it will happen whether it's a fall or whatever. So how do you in your investment process how do you make sense of this versus say something like position sizing like when that moment comes you need to be in a good position for that to actually work for you because otherwise deploying that cash will not how does that process play out. >> Sure. So when we said to create a portfolio uh we don't start out with a cash number in mind. >> Okay. So let's say today if I were to start from scratch I would not say I want 22% in cash and then let's deploy remaining 78%. I would say I want these companies in the banking sector with these weightages. I want this much weightage in pharma >> with uh these companies. After I've run out of all the ideas and the weightages I have in mind, >> yeah, >> whatever remains is the cash. If I find adequate ideas, cash will be down to 2 or 3%. >> Because 2 or 3% we typically keep to meet inflows, outflows so that we don't have to buy and sell all the time. >> So today it's because we don't have enough exciting ideas. So some people say why don't you increase weightage in your existing positions but then you end up overexposing yourself to ideas or sectors. So if I have a 20% upper cap in mind for banking for example then taking that up to 25% does not make sense. I or if I want a diversified pharma basket with one one quarter weightage in a company, I don't want to make individual company waiting 2 and 3%. >> So we start with that. >> Okay. >> Typically in terms of portfolio waiting, we want to strike a balance between extreme concentration and extreme diversification. extreme concentration if we were allowed and if we put 100% of money in one stock >> if that stock fell 50%. portfolio would fall by 50%. Which is not acceptable. >> At the other end if we put half a percent of our uh money in the best idea that we have >> even if that idea triples uh we'll make only 1% return at the portfolio level. So somewhere in between 3 4 5% 6 7% is the target weight that we have. >> Sure >> given the size that we have we will have slightly larger number of small cap companies in the portfolio. >> Sure. >> But otherwise nothing changes >> and flexiap is the place where you want to be. It gives you literally that amount of flexibility across. You think that is a sweet spot even in terms of where the Indian market is, where the valuations are, where you know is that would that be accurate? >> That's correct. So today people argue is our valuations in small and midcap elevated or are uh is this sector elevated? So if you were running a market cap fund or a theme- based fund then we are constrained. >> Today we can go where we find the opportunity. Again there is discussion happening in the media at time at CB what should be the criteria for classifying a stock as either large cap mid or small. Now everyone has their opinion u like we are on the sidelines say how does it matter we can buy all three of them >> so it helps a lot in terms of not having to worry uh so the market cap based funds have to periodically rebalance their portfolio just because a stock moves from one bucket to the other bucket >> even though fundamentally nothing has changed in the company and they would want to own it >> if I am running a small cap fund and the company becomes a midcap and I may be forced to sell it somewhere down the road. I'm saying why worry about that? >> Why worry about that? Okay, last few questions now Rajiv. I want to talk about disruption, right? What does that look like today for you? I mean you mentioned about how so many mutual funds are coming but outside of the capital markets industry in India in general could be AI could be anything. How do you look at disruption now? How do you think that's going to impact us going forward whether it's the markets, companies, sectors, economy? >> Sure. Uh so I think Jeff Bezos has put it beautifully when he talks about retail. I'm broadening that statement to general investing or to the world. >> He said people keep asking me what are the things that are going to change in retailing. >> Uh and I tell them that I don't worry too much about what are the things that are going to change in retailing. I worry about or I want to focus on things which are never going to change. So people are never going to tell me, I wish your prices were higher. They will always want lower prices. They will never tell me, I wish your delivery speed would be slower. They would always want delivery quicker. They are never going to tell me, I wish there was a fewer variety of products on your portal. They will want good variety. They will want good quality. They will never say, I wish quality was poorer. So if we focus on things that are not going to change >> that helps us last long and even things where one thinks that things have got disrupted. The core human need actually is the same. When we moved from horse buggy to internal combustion engine to arguably electrification of the transport, essentially people want transportation rather than uh so if one is invested in the core need of the customer and if we are invested with agile managers uh who are not asleep at the wheel and who are working towards uh transitioning the company I don't think one needs to worry too much. >> Mhm. >> Uh entertainment has moved from let's say linear TV to streaming but end of the day the content is more or less the same. Now people were watching IPL on cable TV on uh streaming. >> Yeah. >> The managers have to be reasonably competent to see the trends and adapt. >> Okay. Uh so >> okay um couple of questions on investor behavior. If I just own nothing but just Parak Parik Flexiap fund, I don't believe in diversification. I'm chasing the one asset or one investment that has given me the best returns in lower volatility over the last whatever 101 15 years. Is that enough for me or should someone diversify? I can't talk about what other people should do but that is what I have done or what >> a substantial portion of my colleagues and >> so we invest uh skin in the game over and above what SEB mandates us >> what one has to realize is although >> it will be one mutual fund scheme but underlying there are 30 well-run companies >> so across sectors across uh to certain extent geography across market caps So we are comfortable but uh individual investors have to take their own decisions. Do you think this generation of investors because I don't think in the history of India's capital markets you know whether it's stock market or mutual funds have we seen this large number of people come in in the last 5 years as ever before you what do you think about this generation like you know do you think it's different it's the same or any thoughts there are both uh signs there are signs that this generation is much better than earlier generation at the same time there are signs that it is not. So it's a >> barbell kind of thing. I think probably both are simultaneously true. >> True. >> There is one segment which is terrible and there's one segment which is phenomenal. So let's take the terrible part first which is there in the SEB report of derivatives. Now people with selfdeclared income of up to 5 lakh rupees up to 10 lakh rupees >> are bulk of the people who are losing 1 and a2 lakh rupees per year. Uh now if you blow up anywhere between uh 30% to 60% of your annual income on gambling then it's not a great thing. At the same time there's a large segment of people who have understood the power of equities. Some of them may have understood it because they got ESOPS with their employers or their foreign employers if they are working in GCC's. They've understood the power of SIPs. They have understood the power of compounding and they are uh coming in. >> Sure. >> So both these behaviors are simultaneously coexisting right now in the market. To your point about post 2020 investors, one will have to hold the judgment. Uh these people were courageous to invest when markets were down. Plus marks for that. They haven't seen a sustained downturn which is the question mark. What will they do when markets go nowhere or slightly downwards over 5 years over 10 years? We'll have to see. last one year I think behavior has been more or less uh responsible. I don't think they have behaved irresponsibly. I think as far as your experience and whatever you narrated so far on this episode goes about how to survive periods when markets go nowhere and you have seen that >> yes >> staying convict I mean you know staying with conviction how would you advise them let's say that from here on when this episode airs for the next 5 years 3 years 5 years the markets go nowhere now that we have you know some kind of crystal ball gazing machine what's your message to the audience on what they should do if the markets go nowhere >> the first thing seems very very elementary or basic is getting your asset allocation right. Uh in March 2020, I personally know of people who had to redeem equity assets which they did not redeem out of fear for markets. They did not redeem because they thought there's no future for equities. they had to redeem because they lost their jobs >> and they did not have emergency corus and they needed that cash flow to survive. >> So having proper life cover, health cover, building a emergency corpus, matching your uh investment horizon with your financial goals. If you have a goal of buying a house one year down the road, you have no business having bulk of that money in equities, it should be in short to medium-term debt instruments. >> Uh so I think those are the mistakes people make which create these unforced errors in uh tennis terminology. >> Uh no one is forcing you to redeem in a bare market. No one is forcing you to buy at the top. But if you don't get asset allocation right uh you end up making those errors. The other thing is do a premotum like we are doing right now. Assume that next 5 years 10 years markets will go nowhere. >> Are you still excited to come to equities? If the answer is yes, please do. Uh enormous amount of wealth is yet to be created. >> Enormous amount of wealth is yet to be created. On that note of positivity and enormous wealth, that is a wrap on this episode. My guest Rajiv Tucker, CIO Parak Paring Mutual Fund. Rajiv, thank you so much for doing this for our audience. >> Thank you for the opportunity. >> Thank you.
